# Job Application Tracker (Python CLI)

## Overview
The Job Application Tracker is a **command-line based Python application** designed to help users manage and track their job applications efficiently.  
It allows users to store job details, update application statuses, filter applications, and maintain persistent records using a CSV file.

This project focuses on **core Python fundamentals, clean logic, and real-world problem solving** without using any external frameworks or UI libraries.

---

## Problem Statement
While applying for multiple jobs, it becomes difficult to track:
- Which companies you applied to
- Current application status (applied, interview, rejected)
- Updates or changes over time

Most beginners rely on notebooks or scattered files, which is inefficient and error-prone.

---

## Solution
This project provides a **simple CLI-based solution** where:
- All job applications are stored in a structured CSV file
- Users can add, view, update, filter, and delete applications
- Data persists across program runs
- Input validation ensures consistency and correctness

The solution emphasizes **clarity, modularity, and maintainability**.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **CSV Module** (for data persistence)
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
- **Git & GitHub** (version control)

---

## Features
- Add a new job application
- View all job applications
- Filter applications by status
- Update job application status
- Delete a job application
- Status validation (`applied`, `interview`, `rejected`)
- Persistent storage using CSV
- Modular and reusable functions
